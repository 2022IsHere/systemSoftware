// Description:	1. run program to allocate memory to add student information conserning name, id and gpa. 
//              2. Memory size is to be determined by the user. 
//              3. Fill student information according to user and check for uniqness of student ids. 
//              4. Feature update/modify functionality for student information. Calculate average of gpa of all students
//              5. Feature read from file 


// PROGRAM CONSTRAINTS: WHEN TOTAL AMOUNT OF STUDENTS IS GIVEN, THERE IS NO GOING BACK ADDING MORE IN LATER DATE

	// 1. do we or do we not need to declare functions with parameters because sometimes I have to, why ? 
	// 2. what is with float numbers and 1.00000 precision presentation even if number is truly with 1.00 precision why to change it ?
	// 3.
